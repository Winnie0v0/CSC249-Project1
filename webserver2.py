    # the browser (Chrome) sends two requests to the server (set up two connections)

    # In order to handle infinite wait during recv when given an incorrect request 
    # (which prevent the browser from displaying content until the server is down),
    # we add a try-catch handler to close the connection that has the unwanted request 
    # and only keep the connection with the correct request.
